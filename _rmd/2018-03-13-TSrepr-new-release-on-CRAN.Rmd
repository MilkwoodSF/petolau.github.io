I am happy to announce that the new version of package [**TSrepr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TSrepr) is on CRAN.
This is my second submission to CRAN and so the second version of my package [**TSrepr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TSrepr), it has now version 1.0.1.
There is no new functionality or new implemented methods in this release, but there was some interesting process before the release.

I submitted the project, [**TSrepr**](https://github.com/PetoLau/TSrepr) source code repository, to [The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/).



## Unit tests in R

testthat, Travis CI, codecov.
